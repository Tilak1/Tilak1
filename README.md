### Hi, I'm Tilak ! 👋

**I'm a final-year Master's student at Northeastern University, specializing in Generative AI, hardware engineering, and wireless communication systems.** I work as a research assistant under Prof. [Tommaso Melodia](https://ece.northeastern.edu/wineslab/tmelodia.php) at the Institute for the Wireless Internet of Things.

I focus on projects that integrate machine learning, embedded systems, and signal processing. Some key areas I'm currently passionate about include:

- **GPU & FPGA-based AI Implementations** ⚙️
- **Generative AI and Neural Architectures** 🧠
- **Signal Processing & RF Data Analysis** 📊
- **Deep Reinforcement Learning & Scheduling for 5G Networks** 📡

Currently, I'm exploring AI model deployment on edge devices, optimizing for ARM CPUs and GPUs. Feel free to explore my repos and follow along with my journey!
